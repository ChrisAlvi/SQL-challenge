# SQL-challenge
SQL homework 
In this project, I assisted Pewlett Hackard as a data engineer in analyzing an employee database from the 1980s and 1990s. I began by performing data modeling and creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), incorporating primary and foreign keys to visualize the database structure and hierarchy. Afterward, I translated the SQL schema from a quick database diagram, generating SQL code that efficiently integrated into PostgreSQL. This code aligned with the ERD to ensure accuracy. Using specific queries, I addressed the company's research questions, uncovering key insights from the data and helping them find answers they were searching for.
